# Frequently Asked Questions

This page contains answers to frequently asked questions about Xenyria. If your question is not answered here, please feel free to ask on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/xenyria).

## How does Xenyria add custom items?

Xenyria uses a custom resource pack to add custom items. This resource pack is automatically downloaded when you join the server, so you don't need to worry about installing anything.

## Can I join Xenyria on Bedrock Edition?

No. Xenyria is only available on Java Edition and we currently have no plans to support Bedrock Edition.

## Can I join Xenyria with any version other than 1.19.4?

No. Due to our extensive amount of custom content, it would be near impossible to support multiple versions. We also want to ensure that everyone has the same experience when playing on Xenyria, so we require everyone to use the same version.

## Can I use mods on Xenyria?

It is allowed to use clientside modifications that do not give you an unfair advantage over other players. For more information, please check out our page on [Modifications](/general/modifications).

## Will you add item/map/feature X from [Insert Game Here]?

Probably not. We're currently trying to primarily add original content to Xenyria, so we're not really interested in adding content from other games.

## Can I apply for staff?

Yes. Check our page on [Staff Applications](/general/applications) for more information.
